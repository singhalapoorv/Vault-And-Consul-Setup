Vault Prod Setup(1st time):

Make sure you setup Consul first and it's service is running.

Create config.hcl file in vault directory.
Sample file:
			storage "consul" {
			  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
			  path    = "C:\\Users\\vault\\consul"
			}

			listener "tcp" {
				address =  "127.0.0.1:8200"
				tls_disable = 1
			}

			ui=true

Now run the following commands:

cd C:\Program Files\vault

vault.exe server -config=config.hcl -address="127.0.0.1:8200"

set VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
