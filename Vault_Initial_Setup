Vault Prod Setup(1st time):

Make sure you setup Consul first and it's service is running.

Create config.hcl file in vault directory.
Set the listener address to machine_name:8200 if you want to access vault from other servers too.
Sample file:
			storage "consul" {
			  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"
			  path    = "C:\\Users\\vault\\consul"
			}

			listener "tcp" {
				address =  "machine_name:8200"
				tls_disable = 1
			}

			ui=true

Now run the following commands:

cd C:\Users\vault

vault.exe server -config=config.hcl -address="machine_name:8200"

set VAULT_ADDR=http://machine_name:8200

vault.exe status 

vault.exe operator init 

Unseal vault from the Vault_Unseal file.
It will be handy to create a batch file providing the unseal keys in the Vault_Unseal file and saving it with .bat extension.
Vault can be unsealed using this batch file from now on( PS:This way anyone can unseal it).  

--------- Enable logging --------
vault.exe login *root_token*

vault.exe audit enable file file_path="/Users/vault/vault_audit.log"
